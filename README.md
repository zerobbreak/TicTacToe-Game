# Tic Tac Toe Game Design

## Project Setup
- Create a project folder named "TicTacToeGame".
- Inside the folder, create the following files:
  - `index.html`
  - `styles.css`
  - `script.js`
- Initialize a Git repository and link it to your remote repository (if desired).

## HTML Structure
- Open `index.html` and set up the basic HTML structure.
- Create a `<div>` element with the class "container" to center the game content.
- Inside the container, create a heading with the game title.
- Create a `<div>` element with the class "game-grid" to contain the game board cells.
  - Within the game grid, create nine `<div>` elements with the class "cell".
  - Add a data-index attribute to each cell (0 to 8) to identify its position.

## CSS Styling
- Open `styles.css` and apply basic styling to the game elements:
  - Style the body with a background color and center the text.
  - Style the "container" class with appropriate alignment and spacing.
  - Style the game title with font properties.
  - Style the game grid with a grid layout and cell styling.
  - Style the "cell" class with dimensions, border, and center alignment.
  - Style the "Restart" button with background color and padding.

## Game Logic (JavaScript)
- Open `script.js` to implement the game logic.

### Game Initialization
- Create an array named `gameBoard` to represent the game board state.
- Initialize the `currentPlayer` variable to "X".
- Initialize the `gameStatus` variable to "playing".

### Player Moves
- Implement a function to handle player moves based on cell clicks.
  - Use event listeners to capture cell clicks.
  - Check if the cell is empty using the `gameBoard` array.
  - If empty, update the cell with the current player's symbol.
  - Toggle the `currentPlayer` between "X" and "O".

### Checking Win Conditions
- Implement a function to check for win conditions.
  - Define an array of winning combinations.
  - Loop through the combinations and check if cells match the current player's symbol.
  - If a win is detected, update `gameStatus` to "win".

### Checking Draw Condition
- Implement a function to check for a draw condition.
  - Check if all cells are filled and no win condition exists.
  - If true, update `gameStatus` to "draw".

### Displaying Game Outcome
- Implement a function to display the game outcome.
  - Display a message indicating the winner or a draw.
  - Style the message to stand out.

### Restart Button
- Implement a function to reset the game when the "Restart" button is clicked.
  - Clear the game board.
  - Reset `currentPlayer` to "X".
  - Reset `gameStatus` to "playing".

## User Interactions
- Players can interact with the game by clicking on cells to make moves.
- The "Restart" button allows players to start a new game.

## Graphics and Animation
- Apply CSS animations or transitions to cells when clicked.
- Optionally, create custom graphics for X and O symbols.

## Testing and Refinement
- Test the game thoroughly to ensure all game logic works correctly.
- Test on different browsers and devices for compatibility.
- Gather feedback and make improvements to user experience and design.

## Documentation and Comments
- Add comments to your JavaScript code to explain complex logic.
- Include a brief description of the project at the top of each file.

## Deployment
- Host your game on a web server or platforms like GitHub Pages.
- Update file paths to match the deployment structure.

## Post-Deployment Support
- Monitor user feedback and address any reported issues.
- Consider adding contact information for users to provide feedback.

## Additional Features (Optional)
- Implement AI for single-player mode using the minimax algorithm.
- Add a scoring system to keep track of player wins.
- Enhance graphics and animations for a polished look.
